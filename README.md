## Firmware Updates
Once a new firmware is available, the necessary files will appear under releases.

How to start the update process:
1. Download the latest fw.bin file
2. Copy the fw.bin file into the root directory of a FAT32 formatted USB stick or drive (exFAT will not work!)
3. Plug the USB stick/drive into the USB Dolphin
4. Turn on your GameCube
5. Press the button on the USB Dolphin using a paperclip or similar to start the firmware update
6. Wait until the green light is constantly on
7. Restart the GameCube

## Compatible USB Ethernet Adapters
The adapter needs to support the USB CDC-ECM protocol (e.g., most Realtek-based adapters).\
Notably, ASIX-based adapters do not support this.

Examples of compatible adapters:
- Tp-Link UE300
- UGREEN 2.5G Ethernet Adapter (1G variant does not work!)
- You can post the device info shown by [UsbTreeView](https://www.uwe-sieber.de/usbtreeview_e.html) on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YtA9aU3BKZ) to clarify if an adapter is compatible
